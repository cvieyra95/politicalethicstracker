           Have questions about your energy bill or how the Orange County Power Authority (OCPA) works? 
          </a></h3>
          <p>The City of Fullerton hosted an OCPA Community Connect event on April 15, 2025, at City Hall, offering residents an 
            opportunity to engage with the Orange County Power Authority team. Attendees could ask questions about their energy bills and 
            learn more about OCPA's locally controlled, renewable energy services.</p>

            The battle for the Orange County district turned harshly personal in the closing weeks of the campaign.
          </a></h3>
          <p>Democrat Derek Tran narrowly defeated Republican incumbent Michelle Steel in California's 45th congressional district, 
            flipping the seat after a prolonged vote count and a campaign marked by personal attacks. Tran, the son of Vietnamese refugees, 
            leveraged his background to appeal to the district's significant Asian American population, while Steel criticized his legal career; 
            the race became the most expensive House contest of 2024, with over $46 million spent.</p>

            The first-year Democratic senator is ignoring one colleague's advice to "dump the House"
          </a></h3>
          <p>In his first months as a U.S. senator, Adam Schiff has brought a confrontational style from his House tenure to the Senate, 
            challenging traditional norms by vocally opposing leadership decisions and actively participating in high-profile confirmation 
            battles. He has also embraced direct communication with constituents through platforms like Substack, where he shares video updates 
            on legislative matters .</p>
